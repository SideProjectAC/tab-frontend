# tabColab - frontend

## how to start
1. ```npm install i```
2. ```npm run build``` 
   
3. Open Chrome Extensions Page:
   Type **chrome://extensions/** into the Chrome address bar and press Enter. This opens the Extensions page where you can manage installed extensions and load new ones.
   
4. Enable Developer Mode:
   On the top-right corner of the Extensions page, you’ll find a toggle switch for “**Developer mode**.” Make sure it’s turned on. This allows you to load unpacked extensions and see additional developer options.

5. Load Your Unpacked Extension:
   Click on the “**Load unpacked**” button, which appears in the top-left area after enabling Developer mode.
   Navigate to the directory where your extension is located, and select **dist** folder.

6. Open a New Tab:
   With the extension loaded, simply open a new tab in Chrome. Instead of the default New Tab page, you should now see the index.html page defined in your extension.
     if you don't want to change your setting with chrome, you can also go to the site below:
      first check your extension ID , then replace it with: [chrome-extension://your-EXTENSION-ID/index.html]
